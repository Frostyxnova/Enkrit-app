# Enkrit-app
THE IDEA BEHIND ENKRIT APP: 
Sanskrit is the oldest,purest and most systematic language in the word but we are forgetting Sanskrit language or you can say we are forgetting our culture.This was the reason why I created ENKRIT APP.
ENKRIT APP help humans to learn little bit of sanskrit language that humans can use in daily life and contribute to make sanskrit language alive.

FEATURES:
In this app,I have created four fragmant activities(NUMBERS ACTIVITY,FAMILY ACTIVITY,COLORS ACTIVITY,PHRASES ACTIVITY) and are displayed in a listview.Each element in the list has an image,sanskrit word,english translation of the sanskrit word and audio for the sanskrit word.
In the fragment activities,I have used adapters to implement view recycling.AudioFocus has been implemented in the app to avoid playing the app audio in case of a phone call or other periority apps playing.
